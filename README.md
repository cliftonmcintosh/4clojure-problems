# 4clojure-problems
solutions to the problems at http://www.4clojure.com/problems

This is a repository collecting my answers to the 4clojure problems. Many of my solutions were completed a while back, but they were only "collected" on the 4clojure website. I am copying them over here as time permits to have them in one file.

Many of the problems were solved early on in my Clojure work. I intend to revisit them now that I have more experience.

See all of my solutions so far by following http://www.4clojure.com/user/cliffmcintosh.
